        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Season and dredge. Pat the chicken dry and season both sides with salt, pepper, 
                and garlic powder. Place the flour or cornstarch in a shallow dish. Then, dredge the 
                chicken pieces in the coating, shaking off the excess.</li>
            <li>Make the sauce. Whisk the sauce ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>Sear. Cook the chicken for 4-5 minutes on each side until golden.</li>
            <li>Simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low, pour in the sauce, and add the butter. Shake the 
                skillet gently to coat the chicken and cook for 3-5 minutes until the sauce thickens.</li>
            <li>Finish and serve. Remove the skillet from heat and spoon the sauce over the chicken. 
                Garnish with desired garnishes and serve with rice, noodles, or veggies. Enjoy!</li>
